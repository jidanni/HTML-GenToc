<h2>Marytude</h2>

<h3>Mary the first</h3>
<p>Mary had a little lamb<br/>
Its fleece was white as snow<br/>
And everywhere that Mary went<br/>
The lamb was sure to go.
</p>

<h3>Mary the second</h3>

<p>In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.<br/>
Find the fun and snap!  The job's a game.<br/>
And every task you undertake, becomes a piece of cake,<br/>
a lark, a spree; it's very clear to see.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Mary Poppins
</p>

<h2 class="notoc">Suppression</h2>

<p>These are things which no eye hast seen, not ear heard, neither hast
they spoken of it unto any man, fish, nor fowl.</p>

<h2>Emergence</h2>

<blockquote>Whenever the literary German dives into a sentence, that is the
last you are going to see of him until he emerges on the other side of the
Atlantic with his verb in his mouth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Mark Twain "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"
