* Overfiend sighs<BR>
&lt;Overfiend&gt; Netscape sucks.<BR>
&lt;Overfiend&gt; It is a house of cards resting on a bed of quicksand.<BR>

&lt;Overfiend&gt; in a tornado<BR>

<P>rain falls where clouds come<BR>
sun shines where clouds go<BR>
clouds just come and go
<P>                -- Florian Gutzwiller

<P>Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.

<P>Rainy days and automatic weapons always get me down.

<P>Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go<BR>
To heal my heart and drown my woe.<BR>
Rain may fall and wind may blow,<BR>
And many miles be still to go,<BR>
But under a tall tree I will lie,<BR>
And let the clouds go sailing by.
<P>                -- J. R. R. Tolkien

<P>"Rain.  Frost in low lying areas.  Temperature 60 degrees. Suggest
t-shirt, vest, flannel shirt, and blue jeans.  Shoes, optional."

<P>A day without sunshine is like a day without orange juice.

<P>A day without sunshine is like night.

<P>Simon: You think he's here to buy the ice?
Gaines: This time of year, he ain't coming for the sunshine.
<P>                 (The Sentinel: The Debt)
