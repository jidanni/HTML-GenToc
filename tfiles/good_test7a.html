<p>It all began with a typo.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Crew dynamics:</strong></dt>
<dd>If Avon, Cally, and Vila are Simes and Blake, Jenna and Gan are
Gens, we have a stable first and second-season interaction. Orac
doesn't affect the equation, but Gan's death certainly does.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>At the start of the third season, we still have Avon, Cally
and Vila, and they're joined by Tarrant and Dayna. Tarrant's a
Sime, and I'd assume that weapons-specialist Dayna is also. And
naturally Soolin is, too. This in itself goes a long way toward
explaining the difference between the first two seasons and the
second two...first and second season, they're a balanced set of
transfer partners; third and fourth seasons they're a hunting pack
of Sime raiders.</em> (MD)</p>
<p><em>When Cally died, the situation became less stable, because
they'd lost their one strong Channel, so they <strong>did</strong>
have to raid.</em> (KA)</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>The Federation:</strong></dt>
<dd><em>I don't think a Sime~Gen Federation would be like the
Tecton; perhaps one reason why the Federation is into conquering is
the neverending search for more Gens... (Yes, assumption that
planets had been settled by Simes and Gens, not by Ancients) Some
planets could well be Gen enclaves, but the Federation would be
Sime-dominated.</em>
<p><em>There would obviously have to be a Channel distribution
system in place, or the Federation would have succumbed to
Zelerod's Doom long ago, but I expect that killing isn't illegal
either. It's just really really expensive. Choice kills. Ohnj
Verlis probably didn't (just) deal in slaves, but in Gens. Gen
relatives of deserters would not be sent to the slave pits, they
would be sent to the Gen pits; not for death, but to be milked by
the government Channels until they died. Gens would be second-class
citizens, but I don't think they would be classed as non-persons.
All channels would be forced to work for the government - but
Cally, not being a Federation citizen, would have received
different Channel training - Auron-style training, whatever that
was.</em> (KA)</p>

<h2 id="sime">Huh? What is this Sime~Gen stuff?</h2>
<p>For those of you completely confused, a small explanation must
be given. The Sime~Gen universe is a fictional creation of <a href=
"http://www.simegen.com/bios/jlbio.html">Jacqueline Lichtenberg</a>
in which humanity has mutated into two forms - the
<em>selyn</em>-producing Gens, and the tentacled (on their arms)
Simes which feed on <em>selyn</em>. <em>Selyn</em> is a kind of
life-energy which Simes can detect. Unfortunately, for most Simes,
taking the selyn from a Gen kills the Gen. A Channel is a Sime who
can take selyn from a Gen without killing them, and
<em>channel</em> it to other Simes. Some Gens also, with proper
talent and training, are able to donate selyn to any sime (not just
Channels) without being killed.</p>
